# Knowledge Base

Welcome to my personal knowledge base. Here are my notes from quite a few years
of learning about random topics on UNIX, cybersecurity and programming. Most of
it from setting up my own lab and trying to keep it simple and secure.

For the most part, articles are closer to cheatsheets than knowledge articles
and the aim is to have a reference for quick reminders on how to do things when
you have already done it before and are familiar with it. You will also find
some quick fixes for (sometimes) very specific issues that I could not find
anywhere else. 

Hope you find this wiki useful!
