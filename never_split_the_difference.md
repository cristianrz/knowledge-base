# Never split the difference 

## Goal

- People want to be understood and accepted. 2 primal urges:
	- Need to feel safe & secure
	- Need to feel in control
- Listen intensely -> demonstrate empathy + show a sincere desire to better understand what the other side is experiencing

## Prepare

- Goal: reveal surprises in negotiation
- Hypotheses vs. assumptions: use negotiation to test hypotheses
- Uncover as much information as possible (not battle of arguments)
- Uncover what counterpart actually needs (money, emotional, otherwise) -> get
them feeling safe to talk more
- Sole focus: the other person and what they have to say

## Tone

- Smile
- Slow. It. Down
- Three voices
	- Late-night DJ voice: use selectively to make a point. Inflect voice
downward. Calm and slow. Creates aura of trustworthiness without triggering
defensivenes.
	- Positive & playful: Default voice. Voice of easygoing & good-natured
person. Relax and smile while talking
	- Direct / assertive: used rarely

## Mirror

- Repeat the last (or critical) 3 words of what someone else has said
- Insinuates similarity which facilitates bonding
- Connectors because they help your counterpart connect thoughts

## Mirror process

- Use late night FM DJ voice.
- Start sentences with *I'm sorry*
- Mirror
- Silence. At least 4 seconds to let the mirror work its magic.
- Repeat.

## Tactical empathy

- Imagine myself in the counterpart's situation
- Recognize their perspective and vocalize that recognition
- Understand counterpart's feelings and hear what is behind those feelings
- Bring my attention to the emotional obstacles to getting an agreement done
- Look at words, tone and body language. Spot changes and look for
incongruencies.

## Labels

- Validate someone's emotion by acknowledging it
- It seems like...
- It sounds like...
- It looks like...
- Pause to let the label sink in. Other party will fill in the silence.
