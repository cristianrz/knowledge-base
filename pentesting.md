# Pentesting

## Five stages of hacking

1. Reconaissance
1. Scanning and enumeration
1. Gaining access
1. Maintaining access
1. Covering tracks

## Physical/Social

* Google street view

* hunter.io

* googling
	
	* filetype/ext
	
* theharvester (emails, subdomains)

* haveibeenpwned

* bluto: brute force against have i been pwned

* crt.sh: \*.domain.com

* wappalyzer: technologies on a website

## Vulnerability scanners

* Nessus
	* Pro edition
* nikto
* burp suite (for web apps)
	* Pro edition (400USD)

## Routing

* process:
	1. find all the entries in the list that match subnet mask and network
	2. use the one that has the longest subnet mask
	3. if none of them matches, use the default rule (0.0.0.0)
* routers change MAC addresses but they don't change IPs
* FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF is the broadcast MAC address
* routers do not forward packets with broadcast MAC

## Layers

* Layer 1: cable
* layer 2: MAC addresses
	* 48 bit
* layer 3: IP addresses
