# Memory Safe Languages

## High level
* Zig (12.1k)
	* no garbage collection
	* on-par with C on performance
	* cross-compilation easy
	* Windows
	* not really memory safe, manual memory management
	* not self-hosted
* D (5.2k)
	* self hosted
	* it is a system language
	* not fully safe, only a subset
* V (26.5k)
	* really fast
	* not self-hosted
	* alpha
	
## Pass

* Nim (12.4k)
	* Python syntax
	* has GC
	* can do low level
	* self hosted
	* compiles to C
* Ada (231)
	* It's self hosted
	* tries to be memory safe but can't guarantee (SPARK can)
* Go (38.9k)
	* has GC
	* self hosted
	* not system programming
* Crystal (17.2k)
	* high-level
	* has GC
	* Self hosted
	* no ARM builds
* Swift (21.3k)
	* high-level
	* not really systems programming
	* not self-hosted
