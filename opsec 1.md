OPSEC steps

1.  identify what you need to protect
2.  identify the threats that are most likely to target you and your data    
3.  identify the vulnerabilities that will make it easy for an attacker to gain access to you or your data    
4.  assess the risk of the likelihood of an attacker exploiting each vulnerability and the impact it will have on you and your data  
5.  put counter measures in place
