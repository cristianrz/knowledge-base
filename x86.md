## Registers

- ESP (Extended Stack Pointer) is a register that is used to keep track of the location of the stack in memory. The stack is a region of memory that is used to store data temporarily during a program's execution.
- EAX (Extended Accumulator) is a general-purpose register that is used to store data during arithmetic and logical operations. It is often used to hold the results of computations.
- EBP (Extended Base Pointer) is typically used as a frame pointer to mark the beginning of a function's stack frame. A stack frame is a portion of the stack that is reserved for a specific function call.
- EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer) is a register that is used to keep track of the address of the next instruction to be executed in a program. It is sometimes called the "program counter" because it keeps track of where the program is currently executing.
